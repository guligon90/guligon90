Enthusiast and student of Mathematics and technology. Concerning software development for the web, my experience is concentrated on:

- TypeScript;
- React ecosystem: React.js and React Native;
- Node.js stacks: NestJS, Express and Koa.js;
- Python stacks: Django, FastAPI and Flask;
- Mobile: Flutter for Android.

My interests, concerning software architecture and design patterns, are:

 - Clean Architecture;
 - Domain-Driven Design (DDD);
 - SOLID principles.
 
 Concerning the above topics, I recommend the reading of Khalil Stemmler's [articles](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/). 

My interests in Mathematics reside in the following fields:

- Algebraizable logic systems;
- Artificial neural networks applied to data deduplication;
- Graph theory applied to computational complexity problems;
- Natural Language Processing;
- Numerical methods (PDEs & optimization).
