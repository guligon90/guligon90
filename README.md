Surrounded by AI-aided animals masquerading as rational human beings. Trapped in a world where I have to work for incompetent fools just to survive. What? Were you expecting a cute and fragrant presentation? Were you expecting to see some meaningless soyboy Github stats in this README? Were you expecting some meaningless summary of my "past professional glories" or academic qualifications? Well, too bad for you. Besides, all of that doesn't matter anymore. After 13 years working as a software engineer, and as a Math teacher, I no longer care. [Terry A. Davis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K8IEzXnMYk) was right.
