Enthusiast and student of Mathematics and Technology. Concerning software development, my experience is concentrated on:

- React ecosystem: (React.js || React Native) && TypeScript;
- Node.js stacks: (Express.js || Koa.js) && TypeScript;
- Python stacks: (Django || FastAPI || Flask);

 - Clean Architecture;
 - Domain-Driven Design (DDD);
 - SOLID principles.
 
 Concerning the above topics, I recommend the reading of Khalil Stemmler's articles: (https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/).

My interests in Mathematics reside in the following fields:

- Algebraizable logic systems;
- Artificial neural networks applied to data deduplication;
- Graph theory applied to computational complexity problems;
- Natural Language Processing;
- Numerical methods (PDEs & optimization).
